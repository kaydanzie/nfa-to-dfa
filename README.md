#NFA to DFA
Write a Java program that takes the specification for a non-deterministic finite automaton (NFA) as input and outputs the specification for an equivalent deterministic finite automaton (DFA).The NFA input specification will be passed as a command line argument and be of the following form:

-Line 1: A list of states
-Line 2: A list of symbols
-Line 3: Start state
-Line 4: Set of accept states
-Line 5 to EOF: Transition function
